# React Go

This is an implementation of the Go board game in React. I'm writing this for fun to learn Typescript & get some practice with React/CSS after a little break from frontend development.

Plan to deploy this as a static site to AWS once I'm done. Writing this with extensibility in mind so I can build it out into a online app down the line.
